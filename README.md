# Firebase SDK Initialization and Configuration Errors

This repository demonstrates common errors related to Firebase SDK initialization and configuration in JavaScript. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how incorrect initialization can lead to runtime exceptions. The solution, provided in `firebaseBugSolution.js`, highlights best practices for setting up Firebase properly.

## Problem
Improper initialization of the Firebase SDK can result in errors when trying to interact with Firebase services such as authentication, databases, or storage. This often leads to cryptic error messages which are difficult to debug.

## Solution

Verify your Firebase configuration file (`firebase.json`) and make sure all necessary dependencies are installed and correctly linked.  Follow Firebase's official documentation for guidance on the correct initialization process for your specific use case.
