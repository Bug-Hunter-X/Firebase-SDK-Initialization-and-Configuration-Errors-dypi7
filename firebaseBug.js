The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the project is not properly initialized or configured. This can happen due to incorrect setup of the Firebase configuration file, missing dependencies, or incorrect usage of the SDK methods. For example, calling Firebase methods before the SDK is fully initialized can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
